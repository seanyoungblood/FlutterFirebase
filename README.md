# FlutterFirebase
This project is designed to be a quick and simple example of an app created using the Flutter and Firebase frameworks.

The app allows a user to register and login, and set thier personal preferences for how they like coffee. The user can also view how other users like coffee.

Security and UI are not taken into significant consideration for this app, as it is simply designed to show someone new to Flutter and Firebase how an app using the technologies is typically structured and developed.
